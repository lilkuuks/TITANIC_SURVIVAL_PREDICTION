# Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic. By analyzing the Titanic dataset, we aim to understand which factors influenced survival and use this information to build a predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset, provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), includes various features such as:
- **Passenger demographics** (Age, Gender, etc.)
- **Ticket information** (Fare, Class, etc.)
- **Family relationships** (Siblings/Spouses, Parents/Children aboard)

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `pandas` - for data manipulation
- `numpy` - for numerical operations
- `scikit-learn` - for building and evaluating the logistic regression model
- `matplotlib` or `seaborn` (optional) - for visualizing data trends
